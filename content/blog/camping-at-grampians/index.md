####Things to keep in mind

- _Water!_ There is a drinking water refill station at the city center, Halls Gap. However most walks are elevated(clearly we are climbing mountains) even the distance of 850m with the heat can dry you out. It is advisable to carry fluids to keep you hydrated.

- _4WD_ . Most camping areas have off roads which standard cars can tread. However Gramps does have a couple of 4WD Adventure. More information about these tracks can be found at the information centre. Heard they are worth visiting. Lets say things can get more comfortable with a 4WD.

####Things we enjoyed the most

![Bell-field Reserve](./bellfield.jpg)

- _Bell-field Reserve_ .
  Imagine two parched hikers on a sultry hot day. They are left disappointed by the Silverband falls. Only reason they could think off - summers had dried it up. They look on the other side of the road and see a hint of glistening blue. They took the chance and Eureka,the highlight of their trip.
  We ended up spending half our day by the lake, nestled between tall mountains. We had a small picnic and the lake was a perfect accompaniment. Perfect ambience for a swim! There were very few people lazing and we had the lake pretty much to ourselves.

  -_The Pinnacle_ .
  The most popular hike here and guaranteed stunning views. It is a 3.2km hike from the Wonderland carpark. The elevation stats : Max elevation: 691 m. Min elevation: 423 m. A hiking stick could really help. The path is well signed and the sights all along the track are great. The lookout on the top has some awe-inspiring views.
  For all those instagram pics,head up there.

  -_McKenzie Waterfall_ .
  On a 35 deg day, this place is a blissful haven. It tumbled down the mountain and pounded against the rock.The bliss-pool at the bottom was varnish clear. A sweet invite to come and dip! There are a couple of easy walks that you can do around the fall.

  There is also a football field which becomes a kangaroo field come evening. This football field is at Halls Gap and cannot be missed on the way back from Wonderland Carpark.
