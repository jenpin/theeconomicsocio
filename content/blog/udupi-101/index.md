Visiting the laws! Nightmarish for some , cordial for others. The feeling of accepting your partners parents as your own ,especially if you are not living with them , can be quite complex. To add to this, throw in the difference in cultures, geographies and even a hint of history. It can be quite intimidating for one.The last time I met my inlaws was at our wedding..
I would be lying if I'd say I was stoked to plan the trip cause I didn`t know what to expect especially after binging on Monster-in-law and the likes. A stereotypical city breed chick married to simple village boy. Well ! family comes first and like the movies you have to do things for love. In short I did have my apprehensions before the trip and some good food was the only saving grace.

So the mister comes from a quaint peaceful village called Brahamavara which is nestled in Udupi. If you ever visiting the magical country and are not short on time, make sure ,I repeat, make sure, you include Udupi in your itinerary and might as well replace it with Kerala. This is specifically for those looking for a quite relaxing soulful holiday. There is enough to do as you take in village life and question the very existence of your being.

Udupi- This coastal town is famous for its cuisine all over the world amongst Indians. However its home to swaying palms, might blue rivers, heavy monsoons and lush, thick green grasses and rice paddies. The mighty coconut palms are omnipresent and just add to the tropical vibe.

D's home is a very traditional Mangalorean household which is complete with a house dog - Rover.Pretty much most of their food is home grown, from mangoes to jackfruit to pepper to cotton.Back in the days they had a family cow and hens which catered for the milk and eggs.
Though they do have LPG which comes in cylinders, the mother loves her outdoor wood-fire to cook rice.
All the organic waste is used as manure for the trees and the plastic is sadly burnt.
Their only source of water is the well ,which has been supplying water for more than 100 years.

My verdict after spending exactly 2 weeks in this paradise is - I want to retire here.

Our mornings were spent sitting on the porch sipping hot cups of milky tea while Rover faithfully lay by our side and kept us company as we bird watched. Kingfishers , tiny lil colorful birds and the majestic peacock. We had our eyes peeled and ears ready for every faint chirp. We were also visited religiously by throngs of wild monkeys in search of their breakfast. The sad aftermaths of urban civilization. When humans take over someones natural habitat what choice do they have.

It soon became a routine as the jet lagged us got up at 6. This was the best time to take in nature and experience the simple yet rich pleasures of life. It was this quality time that made us wonder about our very purpose in life and the kind of lives we want to lead. These soulful chats were accompanied with cups of milky brown Indian tea. The one where your tea concoction is boiled with a generous douse of milk until its slightly thick and creamy.

Next stop was breakfast at the local eatery. The piping hot crunchy dosa and vadas were simply out of this world.
