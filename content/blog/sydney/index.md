You haven't seen Australia if you have not seen Sydney. Period.
Love it , Hate it but you just cannot ignore it.
It was my fifth visit to this pulsating ,fast paced fashion capital of Australia.And it was this time that I fell in love with Sydney. My first four visits were totally nerve wrecking and put me off Sydney.But I guess that's with every place and the pockets you visit.

I asked my mother and my aunt, what was the Australian experience that is etched in their mind. Pat came the reply,the Opera House!!!
It made me smile. I am glad they fell in love with the city on their first visit.

I guess it also depends on how you go about seeing the city. If you are more of an without-a-plan explorer (which is the category I fall in), you might miss out on the ingrained beauty of Sydney. You might scum to the commercial trap of Bondi or the Toroonga zoo and miss out on the hidden stars - the quaint laneways of Wynyard or the tranquil Chinese Garden of Friendship that is silently glows in the bustling busy Darling Harbor.

Don't get me wrong! I have spent several Sydney visits at the bars along Kings Wharf but none of them have awed me. This visit involved meandering the streets, taking in the towering skyspacers and Boy, did I enjoy it!!! The whackiest bit of the city was having a this old artistic two storeyed snuggled right between these shiny glassy modern towers and yet not sticking out as a sore thumb. It was the perfect amalgamation of the new and the old.

On this visit I was presented with a totally different side of Sydney. We did the iconic Opera House and saw the Harbor bridge (My hobbling parents would not have survived the Harbour walk though that used to be my best Sydney experience)
What I brought back from this trip was more learnings about myself and of the city.
The kind of traveler I am and the kind of things I really enjoy . Also Sydney is not all about the crowded suburbs that remind me of Mumbai. The city has a charm that sings of why people fall in love with a place.

A key to this experience has alot to do with the place we chose to stay at during our visit. It was this old popular pub which had a floor they let out.The wynyard hotel. I would totally recommend the place. Smack in the middle of the action!
The only let down especially if you are a light sleeper you might not get any sleep at this place.
The location is key. we were just 850 m away from Darling Harbor and 1 km from Museum.
Post dinner stroll meant going through the shopping district and watching people .....

On the first day after walking around Circular Quay, we took the ferry to watson bay. This place is another hidden star.
The sight all along the land are picturesque. Its the ferry ride that is the winner though
